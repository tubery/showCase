					<p class="about-text">
						Other than video games, I haven't found anything that I
						have been passionate about. However, when I worked as an
						IT technician, I discovered my passion for tech-related
						things. This led me to pursue a degree in computer
						science.
					</p>
					<p class="about-text">
						During my studies, I enjoyed learning the theory and
						practical aspects. However, I needed a speciality since
						I enjoyed all aspects of the course.
					</p>
					<p class="about-text">
						My efforts were all over the place, evident in my course
						choices during my third year. These were artificial
						intelligence, data visualisation, cybersecurity and
						machine learning.

					<h3 class="fac-text">Why I am interested in applying</h3>
					<p class="fac-text">
						For my final project at university, I decided to make a
						web app which sparked my interest in web development.
						Web development balances visual feedback with the
						abstract side of coding.
					</p>
					<p class="fac-text">
						After leaving university with little success and
						confidence in my abilities, I started looking at boot
						camps to upskill and find a speciality.
					</p>
					<p class="fac-text">
						I am applying to FaC (Founders and Coders) to help me
						transition into web development. While I have a good
						foundation, I need more area-specific knowledge and
						guidance, which FaC could be.
					</p>
					<h3 class="fac-text">
						Founders and Coders instead of other boot camps
					</h3>
					<p class="fac-text">
						One of the things I miss is having peers to learn from
						and to add extra motivation to improve so I can keep up
						with more talented developers. Joining a boot camp would
						add another slight push towards my goal.
					</p>
					<p class="fac-text">
						Another aspect which interests me is the mentoring
						aspect which is incredibly valuable as people who work
						in the industry can lend experiences to help
						inexperienced people.
					</p>
					<p class="fac-text">
						Compared to other boot camps, I have yet to see one that
						requires interviews and projects; however, this is an
						advantage as it pushes prospects to try learning
						themselves, see if it is enjoyable, and show eagerness.
