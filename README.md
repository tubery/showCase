# Personal Notes / Dev Notes

Since I was working on projects for the previous cohort I have a better idea of
what I would like my website to look like

The biggest problem is the deadline as of writing this I have less than a month
to complete the showcase and game

With this deadline I will try to implement the best I can and hopefully it will
be enough

The first step is to planning, analysis and design so I will be off this README
creating my planning my website

Scaffolding is the next step and creating a basic layout of the website

Next will be making the website in gray scale later implementing colours

The website will be built for mobile first then will be reactive to screen size
changes

Implementing features and polishing the website along with testing will be next

This will be repeated until completion
