# Personal Notes / Dev Notes

18/06/23

Since I was working on projects for the previous cohort I have a better idea of
what I would like my website to look like

The biggest problem is the deadline as of writing this I have less than a month
to complete the showcase and game

19/06/23

With this deadline I will try to implement the best I can and hopefully it will
be enough

Since I dont have much time I will skip learning things too in depth instead I
will have to pickup the information I need to know as I go

I will learn how to design properly later on for now I will create a basic
wireframe in figma

20/06/23

Now that I have completed a wireframe I can start implementing and putting in
the details which are lacking from the low fidelity

Wireframe -

Navigation bar - Doing the navigation bar first as it will be present throughout
every viewport and it is the topmost element

Using SVGs I created a hamburger, I learned this from
https://youtube.com/watch?v=R00QiudbD4Y&t=2658s

Now I need to give it functionality I will do this myself as I don't want to
depend fully on the tutorial

24/06/23

Today I will make as much progress as possible starting with the navigartion
then moving to the home/hero section and more

I have implemented a navigation bar which I am quite happy with functionality
wise however I was unable to solve an issue regarding the menu on iPhone SE
which shows a white space meaning a container is not the right size which I
could not debug however it only appears on this specific view

Now it is time to work on the hero section

Created a hero section with shooting star animations while it still needs polish
and the right colours i am happy with it for now

25/06/23

About section complete functionality wise also as it is quite simple I will also
be trying to complete the web development section today

I have completed the web development section however as with all the other
sections it is designed for mobile at the moment I will later correct the whole
website for responsiveness and colour

Code is also messy and unstructure will have to clean up later

26/06/23

I have run out of ideas on how to create the last section of the website since I
am not happy with it I will need to rethink this part

27/06/23

Now that I have got most of the basic design out I will try to refine the work
and add things. Since I am low on time this will have to be hacked together as
best as I can.

28/06/23

Taking inspiration from other creators and implementing designs myself I have
more confidence in my css as I am able to see how they made it. Mostly I need
help with colours and design as they are a whole extra skill to learn and hone.
So I have referenced most colurs for the planets

29/06/23

Stuck on making saturn due to its split parts to create visual of rings I will
need a simpler version of it or use someone elses design

02/07/23

Finished making saturn after modelling it after a design I found. Now I can
finish up and write the content and submit this project

03/07/23

I have run out of time to truly polish this website and write better content and
find better images but this will have to do as there is only 13 days until th
deadline
